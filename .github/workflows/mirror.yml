name: Mirror Dependencies
# We mirror upstream container images like Migra, imgproxy, etc. because these
# are usually only available on certain image registry and not others (e.g. only
# on Docker Hub and not on ghcr.io or AWS ECR).
#
# For container images that we control, we usually publish to Docker Hub,
# ghcr.io, and AWS ECR.

on:
  # We can't trigger the mirror job on PR merge because certain tests would fail
  # until we mirror some images. E.g. a PR to update the imgproxy image version
  # would fail, because there is a test that creates a container from the
  # updated image version, which would fail because the image hasn't been
  # mirrored yet. It's a catch-22!
  #
  # TODO: Make the cli start test run *after* we mirror images (if needed).
