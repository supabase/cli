# db-outliers

List statements from `pg_stat_statements` ordered by total execution time. For each one it shows the statement, its total execution time, its share of all execution time, how often it was called, and the time spent on synchronous I/O (reading and writing the file system).

An efficient query has a reasonable ratio of calls to total execution time and spends as little time on I/O as possible. Investigate queries with a high total execution time but a low call count, and queries that spend a large share of their time on synchronous I/O.
