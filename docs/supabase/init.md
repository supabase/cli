## supabase-init

Initialise configurations for Supabase local development.

A `supabase/config.toml` file will be created in your current working directory. This configuration is specific to each local project.

> You may override the directory path withby specifying `SUPABASE_WORKDIR` environment variable.

In addition to `config.toml`, the `supabase` directory may also contain other Supabase objects, such as `migrations`, `functions`, `tests`, etc.
